# NetBSD on Dreamcast

A curses based slide deck that I will be presenting on a SEGA Dreamcast running [NetBSD 7](http://wiki.netbsd.org/ports/dreamcast/) at the first Fort Wayne BSD User Group [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Fort-Wayne-BSD-User-Group/events/228902553/).

This is my first ever curses app so it's a little rough.  I hope to make improvements in the future.
